Like I touched on in my comments, I didn't end up using the APIs in the way I wanted to. I wanted to rely mostly on APIs but I ran into some problems. Changing the colors of the rows based on the past, present and future is what initially stumped. And then I had issues with local storage when I found a way to fix the coloring. I ended up with something that works, but isn't what I had in mind. Having said that,the colors change now, you can save text and it displays the current time at the top. So, that's a win. 

Here are the main sources I used
